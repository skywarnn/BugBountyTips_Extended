# [#BugBountyTips](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23bugbountytips) Extended

## Description

This repository contains extended wordlists, payloads, and more. The idea is to extend a basic pentesting toolbox of fancy ideas found in posts on social media tagged #bugbountytips. I start from essential lists created by leading content creators incl. [HackTricks] or [Seclists] and make them more weaponized. 

I didn't create lists, my contribution is based on extending already existing inventories - kudos to their authors!

## Special thanks
